 begining js cursus
 
- Create in a folder an `index.html` file and a `app.js` file.

- Let's link the js file to your html !

  - In your HTML file, insert this code and save : `<script src="app.js"></script>`

- Then, in your `app.js` insert this line of code : ` alert("Hello there !");`

- Now, go to your browser and check if there is a popup with `Hello there` that appears. If not, there is a problem. If yes, erase the alert in your code and let's keep going !

---

- Now, instead of `alert("Hello there !");`, paste `console.log("I am in the console");`

- In your browser, open the console (F12) or right click and select `inspect`.

- Check the console : your text is there.

- We will be using the console all the time to run and interact with JavaScript.
